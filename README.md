# Moonlander
The ai is trying to land between the two flags.

To do this I implemented Q-learning to allow the AI to learn from each try
using a reward system.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

This project depends on the `swig` utility, which can be installed in your
device's packet manager or at [the swig website](https://swig.org).

This project also depends on the `gymnasium`, `renderlab`, and `opencv-python
modules`, which can be manually installed using `pip`.

Install the project using the following command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Josef856/Nvidia-Final-Submission
```

### Running

Once installed, you can open Moonlander.ipynb and run all cells.
The ai should begin training once complete.
Videos of the Moonlander can be found in `./out`.
